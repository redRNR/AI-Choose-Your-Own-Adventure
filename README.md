# AI Choose Your Own Adventure Game

Welcome to the **AI Choose Your Own Adventure Game**, an interactive storytelling experience where players shape their own narrative. This project leverages Python, Tkinter, and OpenAI's GPT API to dynamically generate a branching narrative that adapts to the player's choices.

## Features

- **Dynamic Storytelling**: The game creates unique, descriptive narratives based on player input.
- **Branching Paths**: Multiple paths lead to success or failure, influenced by the player's decisions.
- **Morally Ambiguous Dilemmas**: Players face ethical challenges that test their values.
- **NPC Interactions**: Encounter friendly or hostile characters that influence the story.
- **End States**: Stories conclude with either success or "The End." if the player meets their demise.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Game**: Players begin by entering a theme and selecting a weapon.
2. **Dynamic Responses**: The OpenAI GPT model generates narrative responses based on the player's choices.
3. **Branching Paths**: Players make choices that lead to new storylines, NPC encounters, and challenges.
4. **Game End**: The game ends when the player either succeeds or dies (indicated by "The End.").
